I love the functionality and portability of Google Calendar but I didn't like the interface, so I made this.

To be used with the Stylish browser extension on Google Chrome, style available to be installed at https://userstyles.org/styles/133011/simple-gcal .

May also work on other browsers with Stylish but has not been tested extensively anywhere but Chrome.

Works nicely when you create a Chrome desktop link so it looks like a native calendar app (instructions below).

If you find any bugs or weird things please send me a message and I'll fix them.

Hope you enjoy it.

Here are the basic setup instructions:

1. Download and install the Stylish extension from the link appropriate for your browser here: https://userstyles.org/
2. Go to https://userstyles.org/styles/133011/simple-gcal and install this style

That's it!

If you want it to appear as a desktop application using Chrome, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the Google Calendar website
2. Click on the Chrome Menu -> More Tools -> Add To Desktop
3. Enter chrome://apps into the address bar
4. Find the Google Calendar icon, right click it, and select the Open As Window option

Clicking on the Google Calendar entry Chrome added to your desktop should now open the themed Google Calendar as its own native application.
